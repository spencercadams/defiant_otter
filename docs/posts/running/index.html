<p>Recently read - A Shoe Dog Story - Nike founder and was motivated to run. I laced up my shoes, grabbed the leash and … ran. It&rsquo;d been a couple of months since I ran, but I found it relaxing and taxing, at the same time.</p>

<p>Breathing in-out, in-out and creating puddles as I run from all the sweat in the 90 degree heat, but loving it. By the end of it, my dog was worn out panting on the tile floor, but I was missing something. A community.</p>

<p>In comes Strava.</p>

<p>Running to me used to be freeing and I&rsquo;d find the &ldquo;runner&rsquo;s high&rdquo; easily. Now, with kids and a mortgage, I find running to be a chore. The community that Strava creates is much needed for the motivation to run.</p>

<p>I look forward to using more and maybe create a club here in my local city :)</p>

<p>Since you asked - what was the best part of A Shoe Dog Story. It wasn&rsquo;t the running, but rather learning about the hardships that Nike faced through the creation. Who knew it was so difficult to push the limit and succeed?</p>
