      <description>Using Postman with IBM Cloud Before we get started, make sure you have your environment setup and have documentation ready-at-will:

As Cloud Object Storage development has shifted to non-classic infrastructure provisioned COS, then I would advise setting up your own Postman library, but keep the other library for reference.</description>
