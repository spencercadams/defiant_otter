## "Creativity confined virtually"

Over the last 5 years I have spent my career exploring how companies take advantage of an operational expense model. I have successfully onboarded multiple organizations, small and large, to an IaaS model. Initially at HP I examined the capital expenditures of purchases equipment for colocation facilities and on premise datacenter. My focused pivoted to IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, when joining RightScale then later/currently SoftLayer, an IBM company.

In a recent endeavor, I have also expanded my expertise to my own organization - (TEKNOLOGENT) - http://bit.ly/2h2ZP7O

My current and future professional goals are to engage with companies looking to learn about the advantages of an -aaS model. Further, I am looking to continue my learning of new business models and ideas. “The world is your oyster.”

Please contact me if you would like to learn more about the state of affairs for the -aaS economy and/or if you would like to learn more about a fast-growing company in transition. Our team is ever evolving and we are always searching for talented individuals.
