## What does it mean to Run?

Recently read - A Shoe Dog Story - Nike founder and was motivated to run. I laced up my shoes, grabbed the leash and … ran. It'd been a couple of months since I ran, but I found it relaxing and taxing, at the same time.

Breathing in-out, in-out and creating puddles as I run from all the sweat in the 90 degree heat, but loving it. By the end of it, my dog was worn out panting on the tile floor, but I was missing something. A community.

In comes Strava.

Running to me used to be freeing and I'd find the "runner's high" easily. Now, with kids and a mortgage, I find running to be a chore. The community that Strava creates is much needed for the motivation to run.

I look forward to using more and maybe create a club here in my local city :)

Since you asked - what was the best part of A Shoe Dog Story. It wasn't the running, but rather learning about the hardships that Nike faced through the creation. Who knew it was so difficult to push the limit and succeed?
